### output
Contains plot of the first two dimensions of the Pima dataset showing the two classes as 'x' and 'o'.

### np_demo.py
Demonstrates various numpy methods.

### pcn.py
Contains the Perceptron class. Uses vanilla python for the most part.

### pcn_logic_demo.py
Perceptron demo on basic logic functions.

### pcn_logic_eg.py
Same as pcn.py and pcn_np.py except that it prints the weights at each step.

### pcn_mnist_demo.py
Perceptron demo using the MNIST dataset.

### pcn_np.py
Contains the Perceptron class. Same as pnc.py except that it uses numpy for most computation.
