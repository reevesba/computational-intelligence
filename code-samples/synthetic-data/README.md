# Synthetic Data Generation Methods

### Conditional GAN
Utilizes a generative adversarial network to generate realistic synthetic data.

### Gaussian Mixture Model
Generates sythetic data and selects the most realistic set by comparing BIC.

### Data
Input data for training the conditional GAN.

### Output
1. Plot showing the selected data from the Gaussian Mixture Model
2. CSV containing the data generated by the conditional GAN.
