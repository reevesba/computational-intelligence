# Code Samples

[Perceptron](simple-perceptron.py): Collection of McCulloch and Pitts neurons together with a set of inputs and weights. The weights connect the inputs to the neurons and act as synapses. 

[Numpy Perceptron](simple-perceptron-np.py): Same as Perceptron, only simplfying things with numpy.

[Numpy Demo](numpy-demo.py): Experimenting with numpy library.
