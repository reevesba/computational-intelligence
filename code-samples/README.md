### Perceptron 
Collection of McCulloch and Pitts neurons together with a set of inputs and weights. The weights connect the inputs to the neurons and act as synapses. 

### Multi Layer Perceptron
An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.

### Linear Regression
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

### Synthetic Data
Methods for generating realistic synthetic data.
