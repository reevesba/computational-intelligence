# Code Samples

### Perceptron 
Collection of McCulloch and Pitts neurons together with a set of inputs and weights. The weights connect the inputs to the neurons and act as synapses. 

### Linear Regression
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

### Synthetic Data
Methods for generating realistic synthetic data.
